- **Performance Dashboard** (Score: 1.75) - Real-time P&L and trade history
- **Basic Risk Management** (Score: 1.60) - Stop-loss and take-profit
- **MetaMask Integration** (Score: 1.50) - Secure wallet connection
- **DEX Monitoring System** (Score: 1.43) - Core functionality for opportunity detection
- **Trade Execution Engine** (Score: 1.25) - Automated buy/sell execution

### Should Have (Next Iteration)
*Important features for the next development phase*

- **Achievement System** (Score: 1.50) - Expanded gamification features
- **Advanced Analytics** (Score: 1.17) - Detailed performance metrics and insights
- **Multi-DEX Support** (Score: 0.89) - Beyond Uniswap to PancakeSwap, SushiSwap
- **Flashbots Integration** - MEV protection and private mempool access
- **Historical Backtesting** - Test strategies against historical data
- **Alert System** - Notifications for trading opportunities

### Could Have (Future Consideration)
*Desirable but not necessary features*

- **Portfolio Management** (Score: 0.88) - Multi-token portfolio tracking
- **Social Trading Features** (Score: 0.71) - Share strategies and follow traders
- **Advanced Order Types** - Limit orders, trailing stops, DCA
- **Cross-chain Support** - Support for other blockchains (BSC, Polygon)
- **API Integration** - Third-party trading platform connections
- **Custom Indicators** - Technical analysis tools

### Won't Have (Out of Scope)
*Features explicitly excluded from current planning*

- **Mobile App** (Score: 0.67) - Focus on desktop first
- **AI Trading Signals** (Score: 0.80) - Too complex for initial release
- **Custodial Wallet** - Security risk, conflicts with MetaMask approach
- **Fiat Integration** - Regulatory complexity
- **Margin Trading** - High risk, regulatory concerns
- **Options/Derivatives** - Outside core use case

## Decision Rationale
*Document the reasoning behind prioritization decisions*

**High Priority Decisions:**
- **Trading Streak Counter** prioritized despite lower impact due to very low effort and importance for user engagement
- **DEX Monitoring** and **Trade Execution** are core to the product value proposition
- **MetaMask Integration** essential for security and user trust
- **Performance Dashboard** critical for user retention and validation

**Medium Priority Decisions:**
- **Multi-DEX Support** deferred to iteration 2 due to high complexity
- **Achievement System** planned for iteration 2 to build on basic gamification
- **Advanced Analytics** important for power users but not essential for MVP

**Low Priority/Excluded Decisions:**
- **Mobile App** excluded due to complexity and desktop-first strategy
- **AI Trading Signals** too complex and risky for initial release
- **Custodial features** conflict with security-first approach

## Stakeholder Input
*Note any specific stakeholder requirements that influenced prioritization*

**Target User Feedback (from market research):**
- Speed and reliability are top priorities (influenced high priority for core trading features)
- Security concerns favor MetaMask integration over custodial solutions
- Gamification elements appreciated but secondary to performance
- Multi-DEX support highly requested but understood as complex

**Technical Constraints:**
- Rust performance requirements favor simpler initial architecture
- MetaMask integration complexity requires dedicated focus
- Real-time data processing needs influence infrastructure decisions

**Business Constraints:**
- 6-week MVP timeline limits scope significantly
- Two-AI development team influences task breakdown approach
- Open-source strategy affects feature selection and complexity
